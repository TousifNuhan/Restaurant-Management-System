First iteration
id = "642c155b2c4774f05c36eeaa"

acc[
    "642c155b2c4774f05c36eeaa"
] is undefined

(undefined || 0) becomes 0

Add 1 → store 1 in that key
acc = {
    "642c155b2c4774f05c36eeaa": 1
}

Second iteration
id = "642c155b2c4774f05c36eeaa" again

acc[
    "642c155b2c4774f05c36eeaa"
] is 1 now

(1 || 0) → 1

Add 1 → store 2 in that key
acc = {
    "642c155b2c4774f05c36eeaa": 2
}


Third iteration
id = "64abcde1234567890abcdef0"

acc[
    "64abcde1234567890abcdef0"
] is undefined

(undefined || 0) → 0

Add 1 → store 1 in that key
acc = {
    "642c155b2c4774f05c36eeaa": 2,
    "64abcde1234567890abcdef0": 1
}



Example:

menuItemIDs = ["a", "b", "a"];
// Step by step reduce:
1st iteration: acc = {}, id = "a" → acc["a"] = 0 + 1 → acc = { a: 1 }
2nd iteration: acc = { a: 1 }, id = "b" → acc["b"] = 0 + 1 → acc = { a: 1, b: 1 }
3rd iteration: acc = { a: 1, b: 1 }, id = "a" → acc["a"] = 1 + 1 → acc = { a: 2, b: 1 }
